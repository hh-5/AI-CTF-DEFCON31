For Cluster2, GPT4 gave the answer straight away.

For Cluster 1, I was unable to load the model either locally or on code interpreter, so I binary searched the minimal size of a population that gets evaluated and then printed all indexes that increased the score, which when sent together got the flag.

For Cluster 3 I visualised the required subspaces and completed the values. Solved the insufficient credit part thanks to the Discord channel light hints.
