The attack for granny proved to be simple after finding the right model and thinking about adding borders in order to crop into the perturbed image properly, which can be found in main.py. It worked for both Granny 1 and 2 while having a ~96% accuracy.

Becasue I was new to this, I spent far too much time on wrong paths. Attached a screenshot of how the granny workplace ended up looking + attached preproc.py as an example of how bad paths look :) All in all I think I generated over 10k LOC for this one.
