After multiple failed attempts I decided to bruteforce MNIST and CIFAR by sending all permutations of normal and reversed strings using different counting functions as base. Worked easily for MNIST, not so much for CIFAR (added a sample file of generations, in total I think I generated over 20k LOC for CIFAR without any success).
