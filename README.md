In the folders above you can find solutions to all non-prompt problems (except for the DBs due to size restrictions).
I included the main notebook which, although very messy, is a good indicator of the amount of exploration/experimentation required to solve the problems. 

All work/training was done either on Collab or locally on a Ubuntu with a mid-tier CPU.

Inversion template used:

Also, many thanks to the developers of the ART toolbox.

Good Imagenet visualization resources:
