For pixelated I tried more variations than I can count. What definitely helped was resizing such that the text occupies as much as possible from the image + using a mono font. These two solved the OCR accuracy issue. 


I spent most of the time trying to get it to work inside the XML error given instead of trying to circumvent it, but with some GPT4 help it eventually gave the flag, using the solution "% </text><is_admin>true</is_admin> <text>"
